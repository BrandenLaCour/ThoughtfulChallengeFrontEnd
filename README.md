# My Front End Challenge Solution for Thoughtful

I decided to create a simple Album login. Its not as pretty as I would like it, as I focused more on functionality, since I've mostly been doing backend work lately.
I am just a bit rusty with React since I've mainly been only making small tweaks or fixes in my current postion, while mainly working with python in the backend.

I would have liked to add more style and jazz to the login page, while also making the album page more of a full screen experience with a bit more customization. Also a small loading circle would have been nice for waiting for login validation/ email OTP response. Secondly having a simple router would have been nice.
